# ECE150 - Electrical and Computer Engineering One Hundred and Fifty - AKA. Coding for First Year Electrical Engineers 

This is a little collection of all the projects and deliverables I coded during my first year at the wonderful academic institution known as the University of Waterloo!

In addition to that, I will likely store little one-offs in this repository as well - just to make sure they have a home on the world wide web.

Enjoy! :)
