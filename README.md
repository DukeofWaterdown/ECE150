## A Collection of Code Spanning my Time at Waterloo!

This is a little collection of all the projects and deliverables I coded during my years at the wonderful academic institution known as the University of Waterloo!

In addition to that, I will likely store little one-offs and other fun stuff in this repository as well - just to make sure they have a home on the world wide web.

Enjoy! :)
